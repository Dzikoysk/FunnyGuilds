If you want to contribute to the plugin, then you need to follow some simple rules.<br/>
First of all, code style. I'm not gonna describe it, just look into code. I don't have time to correct all pull requests
(if there are any).<br/>
Make sure that you use code that isn't a property of someone else.<br/>
Contact me if you want to help but have no idea what needs to be done.<br/>
Thanks.
